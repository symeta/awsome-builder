# serverless data platform prototype - awsome builder
 
## introduction
I choose serverlesss data platform to be my awsome buildr topic. the prototying system consists of 3 portions, namely the batch processing system, the real-time processing system and the data-mining (leveraging on machine learning) system. this blog archives the prototyping system using 5 demos: 
- [data uploading from on-prem to aws region](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/data-uploading-from-on-prem-to-aws-region) 
- [complicated raw json struct transformation process](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/complicated-raw-json-struct-transformation-process) 
- [incremental data ETL process](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/automatically-generate-incremental-data-table-by-step-function) 
- [real-time data analysis process](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/generate-random-data-in-json-format) 
- [clustering analysis of the target table](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/user-behavior-analysis-notebook-script) 

the architecture diagram is shown is below:
