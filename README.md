# serverless data platform prototype - awsome builder
 
## introduction
I choose serverlesss data platform to be my awsome buildr topic. the prototying system consists of 3 portions, namely the batch processing system, the real-time processing system and the data-mining (leveraging on machine learning) system. this blog archives the prototyping system using 5 demos: 
- [data uploading from on-prem to aws region](https://github.com/symeta/awsome-builder/tree/data-uploading-from-on-prem-to-aws-region) 
2. the complicated raw json struct transformation process; 
3. the incremental data ETL process; 
4. the real-time data analysis process; 
5. the clustering analysis of the target table. 

the architecture diagram is shown is below:
